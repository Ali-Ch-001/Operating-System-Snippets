# Operating System Snippets in C

## Description
This repository contains a collection of C code snippets demonstrating fundamental operating system concepts. These examples are designed to help learners understand the basics of operating systems and system programming in C.

## Features
- Process management
- Thread management
- Memory management
- File systems
- Inter-process communication

## Requirements
- GCC compiler or any compatible C compiler
- Linux operating system (recommended for some system-level code)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Ch-001/Operating-System-Snippets.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Operating-System-Snippets
   ```

## Usage
1. Choose the desired C snippet from the repository.
2. Compile the C code using your preferred C compiler. For example, with GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc snippet.c -o snippet
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./snippet
   ```

## Snippets
- **Process Management**: Creating, managing, and terminating processes.
- **Thread Management**: Creating and synchronizing threads.
- **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory.
- **File Systems**: Reading from and writing to files.
- **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: Using pipes, message queues, and shared memory for IPC.

## Example
To run a process management snippet:
1. Navigate to the `process-management` directory:
   ```bash
   cd process-management
   ```
2. Compile and run the snippet:
   ```bash
   gcc process.c -o process
   ./process
   ```
